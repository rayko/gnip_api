# GnipApi

You can connect with Gnip APIs with this gem and operate data. For now there's only a basic set of apis implemented, but I plan to include more in the future.
The PowerTrack stream consumer is available as well as the listing of rules. Full rules operation will be included later.
Also the gem will support different adapters, currently it's dependent of HTTParty, but I plan to remove this dependency and let the user choose which adapter to use, which can be a custom one of course. You will be able to define your own adapter to handle the http connections. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gnip_api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gnip_api
